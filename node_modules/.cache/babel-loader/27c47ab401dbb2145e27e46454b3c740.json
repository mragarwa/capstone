If I'm ready to commit to going to \ntherapy. Um, so we have not even sure where to start honestly. \n\nWell, um, are you like comfortable on talking to the person \nthat you didn't know before? Or is it, or are you comfortable \nwith those. \n\nHmm. I think I'm open to that. Just, I don't know if I can \ncommit the IB, like willing to that every week, I guess. Um, I \nmean, now I feel like I can like go to some, like go to you \nand talk, but I wouldn't know if I don't think I would feel \nthe same way. \n\nYeah, I think I agree on those points of like having some \ntrouble and talking to kind of random people at first. \n\nAnd yeah, I think this was really helpful. I think just \ntalking helps, so yeah. \n\nHmm. \n\nIt's always so awkward to like end it.
